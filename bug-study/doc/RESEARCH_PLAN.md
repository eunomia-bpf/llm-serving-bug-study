# Research Plan: Production Bugs and Performance Issues in LLM Serving Frameworks

## Executive Summary

This research investigates production bugs and performance issues across major open-source LLM serving frameworks. Through systematic analysis of GitHub issues, we aim to identify common failure patterns, understand root causes, and develop actionable insights for improving reliability in production LLM deployments.

## Research Questions

1. **What are the most common production failure modes in LLM serving systems?**
2. **How do different architectural approaches affect system reliability?**
3. **What are the key performance bottlenecks in production deployments?**
