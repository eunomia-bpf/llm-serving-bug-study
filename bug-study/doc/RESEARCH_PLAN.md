# Practical Research Plan: Production Bugs in LLM Serving Frameworks

## Executive Summary

This research investigates production bugs in LLM serving frameworks using a practical, iterative approach. We leverage LLM assistance for initial analysis, then progressively apply deeper methods as patterns emerge. The study focuses on actionable insights that can directly inform tool development and best practices.

## Research Questions and Approach

### RQ1: What types of bugs most frequently disrupt LLM production services?
**Approach:**
1. Basic: Keyword search for "production", "crash", "OOM", "timeout" in issues
2. LLM-assisted: Use Claude to categorize 100 sample issues into initial groups
3. Deeper: Statistical analysis of categories, temporal patterns
4. Validation: Manual review of edge cases and ambiguous classifications

**Expected Output:** Ranked list of bug types with frequency data

### RQ2: What are the common symptoms that precede critical failures?
**Approach:**
1. Basic: Extract issues mentioning "before crash", "leading to", "started with"
2. LLM-assisted: Analyze issue timelines to identify symptom->failure patterns
3. Deeper: Build symptom-failure correlation matrix
4. Validation: Verify patterns in linked PRs and fix descriptions

**Expected Output:** Symptom catalog with failure prediction potential

### RQ3: Which bugs can be detected with simple runtime checks?
**Approach:**
1. Basic: Identify bugs with clear invariant violations (null checks, bounds)
2. LLM-assisted: For each bug category, ask "what check could prevent this?"
3. Deeper: Prototype simple detection scripts for top patterns
4. Validation: Test detection scripts on historical issues

**Expected Output:** Practical runtime checks ranked by impact/complexity ratio

### RQ4: What minimal information is needed to reproduce bugs effectively?
**Approach:**
1. Basic: Extract all "steps to reproduce" sections from issues
2. LLM-assisted: Identify common missing information in unresolved issues
3. Deeper: Compare resolved vs unresolved issue information completeness
4. Validation: Create reproduction checklist and test on new issues

**Expected Output:** Bug reproduction template and critical information list

### RQ5: How do bug patterns differ across deployment scales?
**Approach:**
1. Basic: Search for scale indicators ("users", "requests/sec", "GPUs")
2. LLM-assisted: Categorize issues by implied deployment size
3. Deeper: Analyze bug type distribution across scales
4. Validation: Survey practitioners about scale-specific issues

**Expected Output:** Scale-aware bug risk assessment framework

## Practical Methodology

### Phase 1: Initial Data Collection (Week 1)
**Tools Needed:** GitHub API, Python scripts, CSV files

1. **Simple Issue Export**
   ```python
   # Basic script to fetch issues
   def fetch_issues(repo, keywords):
       issues = []
       for keyword in keywords:
           # Search issues containing keyword
           # Export to CSV with: title, body, labels, created_at, state
       return issues
   ```

2. **Initial Filtering**
   - Keywords: "production", "deployment", "serving", "inference"
   - Exclude: "feature request", "documentation", "question"
   - Time range: Last 12 months (manageable dataset)

3. **Basic Statistics**
   - Issue count by repository
   - Resolution rate
   - Common labels
   - Response time distribution

### Phase 2: LLM-Assisted Analysis (Week 2-3)
**Tools Needed:** Claude API, structured prompts, JSON outputs

1. **Issue Categorization**
   ```
   Prompt template:
   "Analyze this LLM serving issue and categorize it:
   Title: {title}
   Body: {body}
   
   Categories: Memory, Performance, Crash, Hang, Incorrect Output, API Error
   Severity: Critical, High, Medium, Low
   Component: Model Loading, Inference, API, Scheduling
   
   Return as JSON with confidence scores."
   ```

2. **Pattern Extraction**
   - Use LLM to identify recurring error messages
   - Extract stack trace patterns
   - Identify common configuration issues
   - Find deployment environment patterns

3. **Relationship Mapping**
   - Link related issues using LLM similarity analysis
   - Identify duplicate clusters
   - Map issues to fixes (PR links)

### Phase 3: Deeper Analysis (Week 4-5)
**Tools Needed:** Python data analysis, basic statistics, visualization

1. **Statistical Analysis**
   ```python
   # Example analyses
   - Bug frequency by category over time
   - Resolution time by bug type
   - Correlation between labels and severity
   - Component coupling analysis (which components fail together)
   ```

2. **Root Cause Patterns**
   - Group bugs by root cause similarity
   - Identify systemic vs isolated issues
   - Map fixes to prevention strategies

3. **Impact Assessment**
   - User reports vs developer-found bugs
   - Production impact indicators
   - Recovery time analysis

### Phase 4: Tool Prototype Development (Week 6-7)
**Tools Needed:** Python, basic web framework, GitHub integration

1. **Bug Detection Checklist Tool**
   ```python
   # Simple detection rules based on findings
   checks = {
       "memory": ["Check GPU memory before allocation", "Monitor OOM patterns"],
       "concurrency": ["Detect race conditions in request handling"],
       "api": ["Validate request size limits", "Check timeout configurations"]
   }
   ```

2. **Issue Quality Analyzer**
   - Score issues based on reproduction information
   - Suggest missing information
   - Auto-generate reproduction templates

3. **Pattern Matching Alert System**
   - Match new issues against known patterns
   - Suggest similar resolved issues
   - Recommend preventive measures

### Phase 5: Validation and Refinement (Week 8)
**Tools Needed:** Survey tools, practitioner interviews

1. **Practitioner Validation**
   - Survey 20-30 LLM serving engineers
   - Validate bug categories and severity
   - Collect additional patterns

2. **Tool Testing**
   - Apply tools to recent issues
   - Measure detection accuracy
   - Refine based on false positives/negatives

3. **Documentation**
   - Create practical guides
   - Document tool usage
   - Prepare reproducible analysis pipeline

## Practical Deliverables

### 1. Bug Analysis Dashboard
- Simple web interface showing bug statistics
- Searchable pattern database
- Automated categorization for new issues

### 2. Detection Script Library
```python
# Example structure
detectors/
  ├── memory_checks.py      # OOM prediction
  ├── api_validation.py     # Request validation
  ├── concurrency_checks.py # Race detection
  └── performance_alerts.py # Degradation detection
```

### 3. Best Practices Guide
- One-page checklists for each bug category
- Quick reference for debugging
- Configuration templates

### 4. Issue Templates
- Bug report template with required fields
