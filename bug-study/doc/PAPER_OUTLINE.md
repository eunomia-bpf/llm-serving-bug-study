### 3.1 Research Design and Questions

This study employs a practical, iterative approach that starts with basic analysis and progressively applies deeper methods. We formulate five actionable research questions:

**RQ1: What types of bugs most frequently disrupt LLM production services?**  
We use keyword search and LLM-assisted categorization to identify and rank bug types by frequency and impact.

**RQ2: What are the common symptoms that precede critical failures?**  
We extract temporal patterns from issue descriptions to build a symptom catalog for early failure detection.

**RQ3: Which bugs can be detected with simple runtime checks?**  
We identify bugs with clear invariant violations and prototype lightweight detection scripts.

**RQ4: What minimal information is needed to reproduce bugs effectively?**  
We analyze resolved vs unresolved issues to determine critical reproduction information.

**RQ5: How do bug patterns differ across deployment scales?**  
We categorize issues by deployment size indicators to understand scale-specific risks.

### 3.2 Study Scope and Framework Selection

#### 3.2.1 Framework Selection Criteria

We selected frameworks based on a systematic evaluation of the following criteria:

1. **Production Maturity**: Evidence of deployment in production environments (>100 reported production deployments)
2. **Community Activity**: Active development (>50 commits/month) and issue reporting (>20 issues/month)
3. **Architectural Diversity**: Distinct technical approaches to ensure generalizability
4. **Data Availability**: Public issue tracking with detailed bug reports (>1000 total issues)
5. **Version Stability**: At least 6 months of stable releases

#### 3.2.2 Selected Frameworks

Based on these criteria, we selected three frameworks representing different architectural paradigms:

- **vLLM (v0.2.0 - v0.5.0)**: PagedAttention-based serving with focus on throughput
- **llama.cpp (b1000 - b3000)**: Native C++ implementation emphasizing efficiency
- **SGLang (v0.1.0 - v0.2.0)**: Structured generation with constraint-aware serving

### 3.3 Practical Data Collection Approach

#### 3.3.1 Phase 1: Basic Collection (Week 1)

1. **Simple GitHub Mining**
   - Use GitHub search API with production-related keywords
   - Export issues to CSV format for initial analysis
   - Focus on last 12 months for manageable dataset
   - Collect: title, body, labels, state, created_at, closed_at

2. **Initial Filtering**
   - Keywords: "production", "crash", "OOM", "timeout", "error"
   - Exclude: "feature request", "documentation", "question" labels
   - Keep only issues with substantive descriptions (>100 words)

#### 3.3.2 Progressive Enhancement

- **Week 2**: Add comment threads and linked PRs
- **Week 3**: Extract error messages and stack traces
- **Week 4**: Map issues to specific versions/commits
- **Ongoing**: Update with new issues weekly

### 3.4 LLM-Assisted Classification Approach

#### 3.4.1 Stage 1: Basic Keyword Classification

1. **Simple Pattern Matching**
   ```python
   bug_patterns = {
       "memory": ["OOM", "out of memory", "memory leak"],
       "crash": ["segfault", "core dump", "crashed"],
       "performance": ["slow", "latency", "timeout"],
       "api": ["400", "500", "connection refused"]
   }
   ```

2. **Initial Categorization**
   - Apply patterns to get rough categories
   - Flag ambiguous cases for LLM review
   - Generate frequency statistics

#### 3.4.2 Stage 2: LLM-Enhanced Analysis

1. **Structured Prompt Template**
   ```
   Analyze this issue and return JSON:
   - Category: [Memory|Performance|Crash|Hang|API|Other]
   - Severity: [Critical|High|Medium|Low]
   - Component: [Model Loading|Inference|Scheduling|API]
   - Has Reproduction Steps: [Yes|No]
   - Production Impact: [Yes|No|Unclear]
   ```

2. **Batch Processing**
   - Process 50 issues at a time to manage costs
   - Cache results to avoid re-analysis
   - Manual review of low-confidence classifications

#### 3.4.3 Stage 3: Pattern Validation

1. **Cross-Validation**
   - Compare LLM classifications with manual labels
   - Identify systematic biases
   - Refine prompts based on errors

2. **Quality Assurance**
   - Target: 85% agreement with manual review
   - Focus manual effort on edge cases
   - Document classification decisions

### 3.5 Practical Analysis Pipeline

#### 3.5.1 Iterative Category Development

1. **Start Simple**
   - Begin with 5-7 obvious categories (Memory, Crash, Performance, etc.)
   - Use LLM to suggest subcategories based on issue clusters
   - Refine based on actual data patterns

2. **Pattern Extraction**
   ```python
   # Example: Find common error messages
   error_patterns = extract_error_messages(issues)
   symptom_patterns = extract_symptoms(issues)
   fix_patterns = analyze_pr_fixes(linked_prs)
   ```

3. **Validation Loop**
   - Test categories on new issues
   - Merge similar categories
   - Split overly broad categories

#### 3.5.2 Root Cause Analysis

1. **Simple Approach**
   - Extract "Root cause" sections from PRs
   - Use LLM to summarize fix descriptions
   - Group by similarity

2. **Pattern Mapping**
   - Map symptoms to root causes
   - Identify fix patterns
   - Build prevention recommendations

### 3.6 Tool Development Strategy

#### 3.6.1 Prototype Development Plan

1. **Week 6: Basic Detection Scripts**
   ```python
   # Example: Simple OOM predictor
   def check_memory_risk(request):
       if request.max_tokens > 2048 and batch_size > 16:
           return "High OOM risk"
   ```

2. **Week 7: Issue Analysis Tools**
   - Bug report quality scorer
   - Similar issue finder
   - Reproduction checklist generator

#### 3.6.2 Validation Approach

1. **Historical Testing**
   - Run tools on past issues
   - Measure detection accuracy
   - Calculate false positive rate

2. **Practitioner Feedback**
   - Share tools with 5-10 engineers
   - Collect usability feedback
   - Iterate based on real usage

### 3.7 Practical Validation Strategy

#### 3.7.1 Quick Validation Methods

1. **Spot Checks**
   - Manually review 10% of each category
   - Check edge cases and ambiguous classifications
   - Verify with issue reporters when possible

2. **Cross-Reference Validation**
   - Compare findings with known production incidents
   - Check against framework release notes
   - Validate with community discussions

#### 3.7.2 Success Metrics

- **Coverage**: 80% of production issues analyzed
- **Accuracy**: 85% classification agreement
- **Utility**: Tools catch 60% of common patterns
- **Adoption**: Positive feedback from practitioners

### 3.8 Limitations and Practical Considerations

#### 3.8.1 Acknowledged Limitations

1. **Data Source Bias**
   - GitHub issues may not capture all production bugs
   - Mitigation: Acknowledge in findings, survey practitioners

2. **LLM Classification Errors**
   - Some misclassifications expected
   - Mitigation: Manual validation of critical findings

3. **Tool Simplicity**
   - Detection scripts won't catch all bugs
   - Mitigation: Focus on high-impact, common patterns

#### 3.8.2 Practical Trade-offs

1. **Depth vs. Coverage**
   - Prioritize analyzing more issues over perfect accuracy
   - Use statistical sampling for validation

2. **Cost Management**
   - Limit LLM API usage through batching and caching
   - Focus deep analysis on high-value issues

3. **Timeline Constraints**
   - 8-week timeline requires focused scope
   - Deliver working prototypes over perfect tools
