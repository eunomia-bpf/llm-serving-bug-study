    "body": "### Checklist\n\n- [x] 1. If the issue you raised is not a feature but a question, please raise a discussion at https://github.com/sgl-project/sglang/discussions/new/choose Otherwise, it will be closed.\n- [x] 2. Please use English, otherwise it will be closed.\n\n### Motivation\n\nSimilar to the cross-encoder Score API proposed here: https://github.com/sgl-project/sglang/issues/5577\n\nGoal is to score items \"generatively\" using decoder-only models.\n\nE.g. \"Given a user liked A, B, and C, will the user like this item? Please answer \"yes\" or \"no.\" The item is: D\"\n\n### API\n```\n{\n  \"text_1\": [\n    \"Given a user liked A, B, and C, will the user like this item? Please answer \"yes\" or \"no.\" The item is:\",\n  ],  \n\"text_2\": [\n     \"D\",\n     \"E\"\n   ],\n  \"positiveToken\": \"yes\",\n  \"negativeToken\": \"no\"\n}\n```\n\nReturns: \n\n```\n{\n  \"scores\": [\n    0.874,\n    0.231\n  ]\n}\n```\n\n### Related resources\n\nOriginal idea comes from this paper: [Holistic Evaluation of Language Models](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2211.09110) which states the following:\n```\nWe address the re-ranking task in a pointwise fashion: we formulate the information\nretrieval problem using prompting as a binary log-probability problem, similar to Nogueira & Cho (2019):\nGiven a passage ci and a query q, we ask the model whether the passage contains an answer to the query. If\nthe model\u2019s answer is Yes with a high probability, we rank the corresponding ci higher, while the No answer\nwith high probability achieves the opposite. Figure 12 depicts an example instance. The rankings produced\nare then evaluated using standard information retrieval metrics\n\n```\n\nA Thorough Comparison of Cross-Encoders and LLMs for Reranking SPLADE https://arxiv.org/html/2403.10407v1 \n\nActions Speak Louder than Words: Trillion-Parameter Sequential Transducers for Generative Recommendations https://proceedings.mlr.press/v235/zhai24a.html\n\nMore docs to be added",
