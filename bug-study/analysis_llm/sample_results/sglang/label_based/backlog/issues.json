However, many are unfamiliar with using Docker for development and set up environments directly on their host machines, risking damage to the environment and affecting other developers. To efficiently utilize the cloud hosting resources sponsored by Nvidia H100, I will create a daily updated dev image and provide basic documentation to help new developers get started.\n\n### Related resources\n\n_No response_",

It compares with prefill attn, which is also a triton kernel\r\n2. not run in CI\r\n\r\nFor decode attention, there is no test\r\n\r\nIdeally, we should implement a pytorch version and compare the result under the test folder.
