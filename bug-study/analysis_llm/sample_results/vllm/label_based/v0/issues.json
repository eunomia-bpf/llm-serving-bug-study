(in add method)\nline 26: The block is removed from self.free_table but remains in self.priority_queue. (in remove method, only self.free_table is altered)\nline 28: The block is added again to self.free_table and self.priority_queue. (in add method)\nline 29: The block is removed from self.free_table, and the one added in line 25 is removed from self.priority_queue. (in evict method)\nline 31: block(block_id=862 content_hash=-1708738876872868168 num_hashed_tokens=192 last_accessed=-1) is added to self.free_table and self.priority_queue. note the content_hash is different\u3002(in add method)\nline 32: evict method remove the one added in line 31 from self.free_table but pop the one added in line 28 from self.priority_queue, they have different content_hash. and the error occured.\n<img width=\"1447\" alt=\"Image\" src=\"https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/12b122f0-a8a0-48d1-9f56-615490138bfd\" />\n\nI think in evict method\uff0cwe should compare all field in BlockMetaData to get the right block to return, just like blow\n<img width=\"771\" alt=\"Image\" src=\"https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/eb4e881f-d783-4209-9c3c-71313a84184d\" />\n\nAfter making the change, we tested it and found no problems.",
