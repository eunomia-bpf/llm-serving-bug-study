## Cross-Cutting Observations

1. **Hardware Fragmentation**: Quantization support varies dramatically across GPU generations (V100 vs H100).

2. **Method Proliferation**: Multiple quantization methods (GPTQ, AWQ, FP8, INT8) with different trade-offs.

3. **Model-Specific Issues**: MoE models particularly problematic for quantization.

4. **Performance Paradoxes**: Sometimes dequantization + FP16 outperforms quantized operations.

5. **Rapid Evolution**: Quick resolution of most issues indicates active development.

## Recommendations

Based on the analysis:

1. **Create Quantization Compatibility Matrix**: Document which methods work with which models/hardware (supported by Issues #1345, #2149, #18008)
2. **Add Performance Benchmarks**: Standard benchmarks for each quantization method (supported by Issues #2551, #1242, #3975)
3. **Improve Error Messages**: Add quantization-specific checks and warnings (supported by Issues #2147, #1682, #2074)
4. **Develop Hardware Fallbacks**: Automatic fallback for unsupported hardware (supported by Issues #1345, #2149)
5. **Standardize Quality Metrics**: Report perplexity/accuracy alongside performance (supported by Issues #2543, #3975)
6. **Enhanced Configuration**: Separate quantization settings for draft models (supported by Issue #8784)
