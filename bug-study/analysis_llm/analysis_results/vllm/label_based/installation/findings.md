## Cross-Cutting Observations

1. **Stale Label Prevalence**: 40% of installation issues go stale, indicating persistent environment challenges.

2. **Platform Diversity**: Issues span Linux, Windows, macOS, Docker, and even RISC-V architectures.

3. **Version Matrix Complexity**: CUDA, PyTorch, Python, and vLLM version combinations create exponential complexity.

4. **Build System Evolution**: Transition from setup.py to pyproject.toml causing compatibility issues.

5. **Dependency Hell**: Circular dependencies and version conflicts between torch, triton, xformers, and NumPy.

## Recommendations

Based on the analysis:

1. **Create Installation Matrix**: Document tested combinations of Python/CUDA/PyTorch/vLLM versions (supported by Issues #9960, #18673, #10036)
2. **Improve Error Messages**: Add environment checks before installation (supported by Issues #11037, #4163, #8243)
3. **Provide Docker Images**: Pre-built images for each release version (supported by Issues #20483, #11615, #9809)
4. **Add Installation Validator**: Script to check prerequisites before installation (supported by Issues #9960, #8996, #17015)
5. **Support Package Managers**: Official support for Poetry, Conda, etc. (supported by Issues #5690, #8851)
6. **Enhance Wheel Distribution**: Clear mapping between wheels and git commits/releases (supported by Issues #18673, #10036)
