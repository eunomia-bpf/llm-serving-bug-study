## Issue #N/A: There is a question. If 10 rounds of windows are transmitted each time, can the benefits of the sglang kv pool be enjoyed

### Description

There is a question. If 10 rounds of windows are transmitted each time, the first round of conversation must be lost for requests exceeding 10 rounds of windows. If so, can the benefits of the sglang kv pool be enjoyed? If not, is it recommended not to process any historical conversations? Is this the best way to use sglang in a production environment?

## Issue #N/A: [Feature] Migrate support for FP8 in Ampere GPUs

**Link**: https://github.com/sgl-project/sglang/issues/7715
**State**: open
**Created**: 2025-07-02T12:31:27+00:00

### Checklist

- [x] 1. If the issue you raised is not a feature but a question, please raise a discussion at https://github.com/sgl-project/sglang/discussions/new/choose Otherwise, it will be closed.
- [x] 2. Please use English, otherwise it will be closed.

### Motivation

Hi,

FP8 native models and quantizations are getting more popular. Being an efficient way to deploy models.
The Ampere cards don't have native support for fp8, but their usage is very widespread, like the nvidia 3090. Many people have systems with them due to their low cost and 24GB of VRAM.

VLLM Added support for it with a Marlin kernel and fp8 models load just fine with decent speed on Ampere gpus:
https://github.com/vllm-project/vllm/pull/5975

Currently when trying to load a FP8 model with an Ampere GPU you get this error:
`ValueError("type fp8e4nv not supported in this architecture. The supported fp8 dtypes are ('fp8e4b15', 'fp8e5')")`

## Issue #N/A: [Feature] Maybe the content field in ChatCompletionMessageGenericParam should be Optional

**Link**: https://github.com/sgl-project/sglang/issues/8074

### Motivation

According to the https://platform.openai.com/docs/api-reference/chat/create OpenAI Platform, when there is `tool_calls`, the `content` could be optional. But the current implementation could cause 400 Bad Request when `content` filed is missed under `tool_calls`  situation.

## Issue #N/A: [Feature] Make random-range-ratio give symmetric distribution around --input-length (parity with vllm)

### Motivation

Feature suggestion / request to change the way --random-range-ratio is used, as done in the vllm codebase 
[Fix range_ratio Bug in RandomDataset #16126](https://github.com/vllm-project/vllm/pull/16126)
Â 
There's another recent change at [[Bugfix] Fixed prompt length for random dataset](https://github.com/vllm-project/vllm/pull/17408/files#top) which may also be useful.

Some backstory: the syntax of --random-range-ratio looks identical in sglang and vllm, but the ranges in token lengths are quite different: 

sglang => [input_len * random_ratio, input_len]
vllm => [input_len * (1 - random_ratio), input_len * (1 + random_ratio)]

With a default of zero, this leads to sglang averaging half the input tokens for the sa

## Issue #N/A: [Feature] Add chat method support to the offline Engine class

**Link**: https://github.com/sgl-project/sglang/issues/8084

- [x] 2. Please use English, otherwise it will be closed.

### Motivation

`vLLM` now supports both the `generate` and `chat` methods for offline inference. The `generate` method offers more flexibility, while the `chat` method provides a more convenient interface for conversational use cases.

Currently, `SGLang` supports the `generate` method. Are there any plans to add support for the `chat` method as well? This feature would be helpful for users who want a streamlined conversational interface similar to that provided by vLLM.

## Issue #N/A: [RFC] DRI for every module

**Link**: https://github.com/sgl-project/sglang/issues/7851
**State**: open
**Created**: 2025-07-08T08:14:57+00:00
**Comments**: 0
**Labels**: high priority, collaboration

### Description

SGLang now has a wide range of features and modules, with many efforts happening in parallel across new features, optimizations, and bug fixes. Each module already has an internal DRI (Directly Responsible Individual), but these assignments havenât been made public. As a result, some community pull requests have experienced delays, and contributors often donât know who to reach out to.

We plan to make the DRI list public over the next two weeks and will actively follow up in a dedicated public channel. We're looking forward to working more closely with the community! Cheers!

## Issue #N/A: [Question] Gemma-2 sliding window support?

### Description

Thanks for your hard work on this project! I'm trying to use gemma-2-27b-it with sglang==0.2.9 and flashinfer backend ==0.1.3. Iâm interested in using a context length of 8192 with sliding window attention, which seems to be supported by flashinfer.

However, I noticed that the comments in the gemma2 repository suggest that this might not be allowed. Could you clarify whether it's possible to use an 8192 context length with sliding window attention in this setup?

Any guidance or suggestions would be greatly appreciated!

## Issue #N/A: enable_torch_compile has no effect on Qwen3-32B-FP8 with H20 GPU

### Description

I tested the enable_torch_compile=True configuration on the Qwen3-32B-FP8 model using an H200 GPU, and observed that it had no positive effect on performance. In fact, in some metrics it slightly degraded performance.

Here are the benchmark results for comparison:

### Motivation

sglang 0.30 can run DeepSeek-Coder-V2-Lite-Instruct.
but running DeepSeek-Coder-V2-Lite-Instruct-AWQ reports:
ValueError: The input size is not aligned with the quantized weight shape. This can be caused by too large tensor parallel size.

## Issue #N/A: [Bug] DeepSeek-V3 function call return stop instead of tool_calls in streaming request

### Describe the bug

When utilizing the DeepSeek-V3 function call in streaming mode, the finish reason for the last chunk ought to be tool calls, but currently, it shows as stop.

I think the reason is in servering_chat.py, whether to change stop to tool calls is determined by whether the current parse result contains any tool. If the last chunk is EOS, the pa

## Issue #N/A: PD Disaggregation with tp stuck

### Description

When I execute 
`python3 -m sglang.launch_server --model-path models/DeepSeek-R1-Distill-Qwen-32B --disaggregation-mode prefill --disaggregation-ib-device mlx5_0,mlx5_1 --tp=2` 
the process stuck with logs as follows:

[2025-06-04 07:49:51 TP0] Attention backend not set. Use flashinfer backend by default.
[2025-06-04 07:49:51 TP0] Init torch distributed begin.
[2025-06-04 07:49:51 TP0] sglang is using nccl==2.21.5

It seems that the TP1 process hasn't started, so it is stuck. I want to know how to solve it.

## Issue #N/A: [Feature] Question about kvcache offloading to disk or CPU memory

**Link**: https://github.com/sgl-project/sglang/issues/1072

**Comments**: 0

### Description

### Motivation

In sglang's paper, it mentions that sglang plans to implement a kvcache offloading mechanism. I notice that there is a `disable_disk_cache=False` option in sglang's Server args, and wonder if this option controls the kvcache offloading mechanism.

### Description

Hi, team. When using --enable-ep-moe to start, are the expert weights on each card still loaded in a column-parallel manner? Does this have an impact on performance? I mean will a single expert still triggers all gather communication itself even if it belongs to a single card?

## Issue #N/A: [RFC] Bi-weekly release

**Link**: https://github.com/sgl-project/sglang/issues/7332
**State**: open
**Created**: 2025-06-18T23:17:05+00:00
**Comments**: 0
**Labels**: high priority, collaboration

### Description

After thorough internal discussions, the SGLang team has decided to standardize the release cycle as follows:

- A new version will be released every two weeks under normal circumstances (e.g., v0.4.8, v0.4.9).

- If urgent issues or high-priority features arise between regular releases, we may publish a patch release or an additional stable version as needed.

- Bi-weekly releases will typically occur around the middle and end of each month.

- Each release will aim to include a set of planned features, usually discussed and finalized by the SGLang team in advance.
