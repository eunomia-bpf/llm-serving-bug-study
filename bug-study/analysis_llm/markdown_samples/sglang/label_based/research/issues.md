### Description

### Checklist

- [x] 1. If the issue you raised is not a feature but a question, please raise a discussion at https://github.com/sgl-project/sglang/discussions/new/choose Otherwise, it will be closed.
- [x] 2. Please use English, otherwise it will be closed.

### Motivation

## Description
It would be beneficial to introduce model hooks that allow users to access and modify model activations. This feature would enable greater flexibility for tasks such as visualization, debugging, and custom processing of intermediate representations.

## Use case
* Extract intermediate outputs for interpretability analysis, such as [LogitLens-style investigations](https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/AcKRB8wDpdaN6v6ru/interpreting-gpt-the-logit-lens).
* Expose internal activations, enabling users to cache activations and implement functions to edit, remove, or replace them dynamically during inference, for example [representation engineering](https://github.com/andyzoujm/representation-engineering).
