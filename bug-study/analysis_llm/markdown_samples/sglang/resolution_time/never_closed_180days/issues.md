## Issue #N/A: [Feature] Save cache from requests and load

**Link**: https://github.com/sgl-project/sglang/issues/1932

### Motivation

This might be difficult to implement, but I am facing the following issue:
When running Qwen2-VL on bigger images, the preprocessor takes a long time to convert the images to tokens.

It would be awesome if we could have a way (OpenAI API with extra parameters) to tell the backend to store the cache of a request and load it by ID for another request, which would make it possible to not reprocess every image (and prompt in general) on each call.

If my problem could be solved in an easier way I would be thankful for any input :)

## Issue #N/A: [Kernel] cuDNN attention backend

**Link**: https://github.com/sgl-project/sglang/issues/2272
**State**: open
**Created**: 2024-11-30T06:36:16+00:00
**Comments**: 3
**Labels**: enhancement, good first issue, help wanted, high priority, inactive

### Description

cuDNN provides very fast attention implementation and it is well maintained by NVIDIA. We would like to add a new attention backend based on cudnn.  

## Steps
1. Learn this cudnn paged attention python api. https://github.com/NVIDIA/cudnn-frontend/blob/v1.8.0/samples/python/52_scaled_dot_product_attention_with_paged_caches.ipynb
2. Add a new attention backend "cudnn" here https://github.com/sgl-project/sglang/tree/main/python/sglang/srt/layers/attention
3. We should be able to use it with `python3 -m sglang.launch_server --model meta-llama/Llama-3.1-8B-Instruct --attention-backend cudnn`

- [X] 2. Please use English, otherwise it will be closed.

### Motivation

In most of RLHF frameworks, the prompts are pre-tokenized when data processing, so they can directly pass in token ids to the sglang engine rather than the prompts. So we should add docs on how to do this and how to get tokens directly.

No such.

### Describe the bug

Hi, I encountered an inconsistency in decode throughput reporting. When benchmarking with the bench_serving script, the reported TPOT is **much lower** than the decode throughput logged by the engine. This gap is significant for **small models or high concurrency settings**.

### Reproduction

#### start the server

## Issue #N/A: [Feature] RFC for adding CPU support for SGLang

**Link**: https://github.com/sgl-project/sglang/issues/2807
**State**: open
**Created**: 2025-01-09T07:58:45+00:00
**Comments**: 13
**Labels**: enhancement, high priority, intel, cpu

### Description

### Motivation

Hi, SGLang folks! This is Mingfei from intel pytorch team, our team helps optimize PyTorch performance on CPU. I am also the PyTorch module maintainer for cpu performance. We would like to contribute to SGLang for CPU enabling and performance optimization.

### Targets
Our primary target is to optimize SGLang performance on Intel Xeon Scalable Processors (x86 server CPUs).
* Optimization will be focusing on Xeon with [IntelÂ® Advanced Matrix Extensions](https://www.intel.com/content/www/us/en/products/docs/accelerator-engines/advanced-matrix-extensions/overview.html) support, including Sapphire Rapids(4th gen), Emerald Rapids(5th gen), Granite Rapids(6th gen).
* Native implementations or fallbacks will be provided for CPUs with other ISA to make it functional.
* Providing good performance per dollar.

### Limitations

* Kernels written in **avx512** and **amx-bf16**, requires **GCC11** or above.
* **BFloat16/Float16** will be enabled at the same time on CPU, but we only

- [ ] 2. Please use English, otherwise it will be closed.

### Motivation

The AWQ and GPTQ of TurboMind should be among the best-performing open-source implementations currently available. We plan to integrate them into SGLang, and once the integration is complete, we can consider removing SGLang's dependency on vLLM's AWQ and GPTQ kernel.

During development, we can initially install the wheel https://github.com/InternLM/turbomind/releases/tag/v0.0.1 manually for verification and later add the TurboMind repo as a dependency in [sgl-kernel](https://github.com/sgl-project/sglang/tree/main/sgl-kernel).

- [X] 2. Please use English, otherwise it will be closed.

### Motivation

#  Research Questions

- Explore the tradeoffs of increasing the **number of chips** with more memory, H200, versus increasing the parallel inference **world size** when using less HBM GPUs, H100 (see [[Efficiently Scaling Transformer Inference](https://arxiv.org/abs/2211.05102)](https://arxiv.org/abs/2211.05102)). Reduce as much as possible **price/generation** at **scale.**
- How can we leverage H200 **extra HBM** for efficient KV cache management?  Test long context window.
- Measure the implications of faster GPU **memory bandwidth** while executing **parallel inference**.

## Issue #N/A: [Feature] Regex stop condition

- [X] 2. Please use English, otherwise it will be closed.

### Motivation

Hi! This would be awesome, as it would address following problems:
- most custom stopping conditions can be expressed as a regex
- handling custom stopping in a streaming response does not work as quickly as a backend based stopping condition would

(at least in my testing, a NodeJS client (with breaking the AsyncGenerator for await loop) can not stop the SGLang streaming generation the same way it works with the official OpenAI API)

I hope this is easy to implement

### Describe the bug

Why can't I use multi-lora adapter and radix attention together?
If I have multi-lora adapters, why not just insert the ID of the LoRA adapter before the first token?

When using a multi-lora adapter, it is extremely slow because radix attention cannot be used.

## Issue #N/A: [Kernel] Optimize triton decoding kernels for long context

**Link**: https://github.com/sgl-project/sglang/issues/2271
**State**: open
**Created**: 2024-11-30T06:04:27+00:00
**Comments**: 5
**Labels**: good first issue, help wanted, high priority, inactive

### Description

We noticed the current triton decoding kernel is very slow on long context. This is due to a missing flash decoding like optimization.

## Reproduce
We test the decoding speed with a context length of 200 and 2,000.

triton backend: The decoding speed drops from 147.64 token/s to 126.41 token/s
```
$ python3 -m sglang.bench_offline_throughput --model meta-llama/Llama-3.1-8B-Instruct --dataset-name random --num-prompt 1 --random-input 128 --random-output 2048 --random-range 1 --attention-backend triton

[2024-11-30 05:10:04 TP0] Decode batch. #running-req: 1, #token: 234, token usage: 0.00, gen throughput (token/s): 147.64, #queue-req: 0

## Issue #N/A: [Feature] Add arguments mapping between SGLang / vllm / trt-llm

### Motivation

This is what I need to do for integrating SGLang into OpenRLHF. OpenRLHF already supports vllm. We need to add sglang. I need to map the server and sampling parameters from vllm to sglang. I think this is a good issue for us to let our users switch smoothly between mainstream engines.

**I attached how I am doing right now. But it may be wrong.**

### Related resources

**The args Mapping from vllm to sglang**

These are the server parameters of vllm:

```python
pretrain,
noset_visible_devices=noset_visible_devices,
trust_remote_code=True,
tensor_parallel_size=tensor_parallel_size,
dtype="bfloat16",
seed=seed + i,
enable_prefix_caching=enable_prefix_caching,
enforce_eager=enforce_eager,

## Issue #N/A: [willing to PR] Add Lookahead speculative decoding

**Link**: https://github.com/sgl-project/sglang/issues/2772

### Description

### Checklist

### Motivation

n-gram based speculative is very effective in retrieval augmented generation(RAG). The cost of generating draft tokens is relatively low compared to eagle and has a great potential for accelerating token generation in RAG. Ant group has proposed the Trie-based retrieval and verification mechanism. I want to adopt it to SGLang.
