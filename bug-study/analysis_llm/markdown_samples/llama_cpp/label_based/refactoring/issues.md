## Issue #N/A: ggml : reintegrate the AMX backend into the CPU backend

**Link**: https://github.com/ggml-org/llama.cpp/issues/10359
**State**: closed
**Created**: 2024-11-17T11:35:11+00:00
**Closed**: 2025-01-01T01:07:39+00:00

### Description

As explained here https://github.com/ggerganov/llama.cpp/pull/10343#issuecomment-2480834278, we would like to keep the CPU implementations inside the CPU backend. The AMX backend was created mainly because at the time we didn't support runtime weight repacking. Since now this functionality is supported, we should merge the AMX backend into the CPU backend.

The rough plan to achieve that is outlined here: https://github.com/ggerganov/llama.cpp/discussions/10350#discussioncomment-11282778

> The plan to reintegrate the AMX backend would be to create a new buffer type that converts the weights to the layout that the AMX backend needs them, and then check in the matrix multiplication the buffer type to determine if the AMX matrix multiplication code should be used. Basically extending the same that is done in https://github.com/ggerganov/llama.cpp/pull/9921 for the aarch64 types.

## Issue #N/A: ggml : move LLAMAFILE/tinyBLAS into a backend

**Link**: https://github.com/ggml-org/llama.cpp/issues/10183
**State**: closed
**Created**: 2024-11-05T09:24:54+00:00
**Closed**: 2024-11-17T06:48:36+00:00
**Comments**: 5
**Labels**: refactoring

### Description

The `LLAMAFILE` SGEMM routines are currently called directly from within `ggml-cpu.c` based on compile-time conditionals:

https://github.com/ggerganov/llama.cpp/blob/a9e8a9a0306a8093eef93b0022d9f45510490072/ggml/src/ggml-cpu.c#L7454-L7481

In order to simplify the logic and reduce the coupling of the different BLAS implementations, the `LLAMAFILE` code should be moved into a `ggml` backend, similar to the other BLAS implementations.

Not sure if it has to be a new backend, or if we can move it in the existing `ggml-blas` backend - TBD.

## Issue #N/A: ggml : refactor ggml-cpu.c into multiple C++ source files

**Link**: https://github.com/ggml-org/llama.cpp/issues/10180
**State**: open
**Created**: 2024-11-05T07:12:48+00:00
**Comments**: 17
**Labels**: refactoring, roadmap

### Description

As per recent discussions (e.g. https://github.com/ggerganov/llama.cpp/pull/10144#pullrequestreview-2411814357), we should split the large `ggml-cpu.c` implementation into smaller modules - similar to how the CUDA backend is organized. We should utilize ~C++11~ C++ to reduce code duplication.

## Issue #N/A: server : remove self-extend features

**Link**: https://github.com/ggml-org/llama.cpp/issues/9859
**State**: closed
**Created**: 2024-10-12T07:11:13+00:00
**Closed**: 2024-10-12T13:06:32+00:00
**Comments**: 3
**Labels**: refactoring

### Description

The extra logic added to support this functionality is a bit questionable (https://github.com/ggerganov/llama.cpp/pull/5195#issuecomment-1917507112) and it introduces too much complexity around the context management. With new models available where the training context is plenty (32k and even 128k), we should remove this feature in view of simplifying the server implementation and potentially look to re-introduce it in the future in a better way.

## Issue #N/A: server : remove system prompt support

**Link**: https://github.com/ggml-org/llama.cpp/issues/9811
**State**: closed
**Created**: 2024-10-09T19:10:10+00:00
**Closed**: 2024-10-12T11:51:55+00:00
**Comments**: 13
**Labels**: refactoring, server

### Description

The "system_prompt" related functionality is quite outdated and is introducing unnecessary complexity. It only sort of makes sense for non-finetuned models in order to save the computation of a common prefix when there are multiple parallel slots. But in practice, only finetuned models are utilized for this use case and they always require a chat template, which is incompatible with the current implementation of the system prompt. So in order to simplify the code a bit, we should remove the system prompt related functionality from the server.

## Issue #N/A: llama : refactor llama_vocab

**Link**: https://github.com/ggml-org/llama.cpp/issues/9369
**State**: closed
**Created**: 2024-09-08T13:00:28+00:00

**Labels**: good first issue, performance, refactoring

### Description

As of today we support 5 tokenizer implementations:

```c
        LLAMA_VOCAB_TYPE_SPM  = 1, // LLaMA tokenizer based on byte-level BPE with byte fallback
        LLAMA_VOCAB_TYPE_BPE  = 2, // GPT-2 tokenizer based on byte-level BPE
        LLAMA_VOCAB_TYPE_WPM  = 3, // BERT tokenizer based on WordPiece
        LLAMA_VOCAB_TYPE_UGM  = 4, // T5 tokenizer based on Unigram
        LLAMA_VOCAB_TYPE_RWKV = 5, // RWKV tokenizer based on greedy tokenization
```

The function `llama_tokenize_internal` in `llama-vocab.cpp` currently constructs a tokenizer instance on every call which for some of the tokenizers incurs significant overhead. This should be avoided by pre-constructing the tokenizer object upon `llama-vocab` creation and abstracting the objects (e.g. `llm_tokenizer_spm`, `llm_tokenizer_bpe`, etc.) with a common interface.

However, we want `llama_tokenize_internal` to remain thread-safe as it currently is (I think). Therefore, the tokenizer objects would likely need to b

## Issue #N/A: Refactor: investigate cleaner exception handling for server/server.cpp

**Link**: https://github.com/ggml-org/llama.cpp/issues/7787
**State**: closed
**Created**: 2024-06-06T03:20:52+00:00
**Closed**: 2024-08-16T15:19:06+00:00

**Labels**: help wanted, refactoring

### Description

### Background Description

In https://github.com/ggerganov/llama.cpp/pull/7642 @0wwafa observed unhanded exceptions on windows, but didn't provide a concrete example of a failure to load replications steps, so the root cause is unknown. He assert that every exception should be catched globally.

However @ngxson mentioned that we should do a more local try catch focused on `ctx_server.init()` as it makes no sense to cover `ctx_server.load_model(params)` which will always return false. 0wwafa opted afterwards to close the PR.

Considering that he did observe an exception around this area, we should at least give this spot a lookover to ensure all error cases are handled.

If done so, make sure to at least credit @0wwafa in the commit for the general observation.

### Possible Refactor Approaches

* See if we can restrict the error handling to ctx_server.init() or closer to the error source.

## Issue #N/A: Reorganization of the project files

**Link**: https://github.com/ggml-org/llama.cpp/issues/7573
**State**: closed
**Created**: 2024-05-27T21:03:53+00:00
**Closed**: 2024-06-26T20:14:39+00:00
**Comments**: 7
**Labels**: refactoring

### Description

Since there was some discussion about splitting `llama.cpp` into multiple files, I would like to propose a reorganization of the project files. In short:

- Move ggml files to the ggml directory
- Move llama.cpp files to the llama directory
- Split llama.cpp into multiple files, possibly:
  - llama-tokenizer.cpp/h
  - llama-sampling.cpp/h
  - llama-models.cpp/h
- Possibly move common into examples 

Hopefully this will allow:
- Having a more clear separation between ggml and llama.cpp
- First step towards building ggml separately, and sharing the same build scripts in the ggml repository and other projects
- Improve build time of llama.cpp
- Make working on llama.cpp easier

The tree structure would look like this:
```
├── common
├── examples
├── gguf-py
├── tests
├── ggml
│   ├── ggml-alloc.h
│   ├── ggml-alloc.c
│   ├── ggml-backend-impl.h
│   ├── ggml-backend.c
│   ├── ggml-backend.h
│   ├── ggml-common.h
│   ├── ggml-cuda
│   ├── ggml-cuda.cu
│   ├──

## Issue #N/A: Refactor: Existing examples refactoring opportunities

**Link**: https://github.com/ggml-org/llama.cpp/issues/7559
**State**: open
**Created**: 2024-05-27T09:31:05+00:00
**Comments**: 0
**Labels**: help wanted, refactoring

### Description

[GG in this PR was suggesting a refactoring of examples and provided an example of what he would like to refactor. This is a ticket to inform others about opportunities to improve examples](https://github.com/ggerganov/llama.cpp/pull/7534#issuecomment-2132746334)

> I think a bigger advantage would be to do some refactoring in the existing examples and "hide" some of the state for sampling and KV cache management that we expose behind the common API

- [ ] Hide some state for sampling (unsure what this mean)
- [ ] Key Value cache management should be abstracted away behind the common API
- [ ] @ngxson [suggest restructuring the help message in gpt_params_print_usage() to improve help message clarity](https://github.com/ggerganov/llama.cpp/pull/7534#issuecomment-2133064853)

If there is any other aspect of the example which is currently a pain point for developer grokking, feel free to also suggest some so it can be added here.

## Issue #N/A: ggml : unified CMake build

**Link**: https://github.com/ggml-org/llama.cpp/issues/6913
**State**: open
**Created**: 2024-04-25T19:15:40+00:00
**Comments**: 4
**Labels**: enhancement, build, refactoring, roadmap

### Description

Currently the [ggml](https://github.com/ggerganov/ggml), [llama.cpp](https://github.com/ggerganov/llama.cpp) and [whisper.cpp](https://github.com/ggerganov/whisper.cpp) projects share the same source of the `ggml` library, but have different CMake scripts. The scripts are adapted to the specifics of the projects and are quite similar with each other - all of them build `ggml`. Still, there are differences due to manually rewriting them and applying changes from one repo to another

The goal in this task is to unify, deduplicate and streamline the build process of `ggml` with proper CMake scripts that are shared across the projects. This will simplify changes in the future and will also help other 3rd party projects that depend on `ggml`

More on this topic has been discussed in:

- https://github.com/ggerganov/llama.cpp/issues/5890
- https://github.com/ggerganov/ggml/pull/804

To achieve that, the `ggml`-related sources in `llama.cpp` and `whisper.cpp` would likely have to be

## Issue #N/A: llama : combine expert tensors into a single tensor

**Link**: https://github.com/ggml-org/llama.cpp/issues/6082
**State**: closed
**Created**: 2024-03-15T12:55:03+00:00
**Closed**: 2024-04-03T13:07:06+00:00
**Comments**: 1
**Labels**: high priority, refactoring

### Description

Currently, we store separate tensors for each expert:

https://github.com/ggerganov/llama.cpp/blob/3020327f6cd6d2ce50528dd65f4b199d2ea8b1ae/ggml.c#L4442-L4455

This leads to large number of possible "source" tensors for the `_id` ops which increases significantly the size of `struct ggml_tensor` on the stack:

https://github.com/ggerganov/llama.cpp/blob/3020327f6cd6d2ce50528dd65f4b199d2ea8b1ae/ggml.h#L573-L576

Additionally, the Metal implementation is currently hacked to support up to 8 experts and extension to more than that is not completely obvious:

https://github.com/ggerganov/llama.cpp/blob/3020327f6cd6d2ce50528dd65f4b199d2ea8b1ae/ggml-metal.m#L1750-L1759

We should improve this, with one possible way being to store the data for the experts into a single tensor and address is with appropriate offsets

## Issue #N/A: llama : update the convert-llama2c-to-ggml example

**Link**: https://github.com/ggml-org/llama.cpp/issues/5608
**State**: closed
**Created**: 2024-02-20T09:50:31+00:00
**Closed**: 2024-03-22T18:49:07+00:00

**Labels**: good first issue, testing, refactoring

### Description

The [convert-llama2c-to-ggml](https://github.com/ggerganov/llama.cpp/tree/master/examples/convert-llama2c-to-ggml) is mostly functional, but can use some maintenance efforts. It also needs an update to support the `n_head_kv` parameter, required for multi-query models (e.g. [stories260K](https://huggingface.co/karpathy/tinyllamas/blob/main/stories260K/readme.md)).

Here is quick'n'dirty patch to make it work with `stories260k` which uses `n_head = 8` and `n_head_kv = 4`:

## Issue #N/A: llama : refactor the llm.build_xxx functions

**Link**: https://github.com/ggml-org/llama.cpp/issues/5239
**State**: open
**Created**: 2024-01-31T12:55:44+00:00
**Comments**: 2
**Labels**: good first issue, refactoring, roadmap

### Description

Now that we support a large amount of architectures, we can clearly see the patterns when constructing the compute graphs - i.e. optional biases, different norm types, QKV vs Q+K+V, etc.

We should deduplicate the copy-paste portions in functions such as `llm.build_llama()`, `llm.build_falcon()`, etc.

The advantage of the current code is that it is easy to look into the graph of a specific architecture. When we refactor this, we will lose this convenience to some extend. So we should think about making this refactoring in such a way that we don't completely obscure which parts of the graph belong to which architectures

Open for ideas and suggestions how to do this best

## Issue #N/A: llama : create llamax library

**Link**: https://github.com/ggml-org/llama.cpp/issues/5215
**State**: open
**Created**: 2024-01-30T13:01:06+00:00
**Comments**: 18
**Labels**: refactoring, roadmap

### Description

Depends on: https://github.com/ggerganov/llama.cpp/issues/5214

The `llamax` library will wrap `llama` and expose common high-level functionality. The main goal is to ease the integration of `llama.cpp` into 3rd party projects. Ideally, most projects would interface through the `llamax` API for all common use cases, while still have the option to use the low-level `llama` API for more uncommon applications that require finer control of the state.

A simple way to think about `llamax` is that it will simplify all of the existing examples in `llama.cpp` by hiding the low-level stuff, such as managing the KV cache and batching requests.

Roughly, `llamax` will require it's own state object and a run-loop function.

The specifics of the API are yet to be determined - suggestions are welcome.

## Issue #N/A: llama : move the sampling API from common into llama lib

**Link**: https://github.com/ggml-org/llama.cpp/issues/5214
**State**: closed
**Created**: 2024-01-30T12:44:03+00:00
**Closed**: 2024-09-07T12:17:24+00:00
**Comments**: 11
**Labels**: refactoring

### Description

There is functionality around `llama_sampling_context` currently part of `common`. We should move it into `llama`. Pretty much the entire API from `common/sampling.h` except `llama_sampling_params` and `llama_sampling_sample` can be integrated into the library.

This would probably require to also merge the grammar parser into the `llama` lib implementation.

The `llama_sampling_params` and `llama_sampling_sample` will stay in `common` since they are very example-specific and not general-purpose enough to be merged.

## Issue #N/A: llama : integer type consistency in `llama.h`

**Link**: https://github.com/ggml-org/llama.cpp/issues/4574
**State**: open
**Created**: 2023-12-21T19:55:14+00:00
**Comments**: 2
**Labels**: enhancement, good first issue, refactoring, roadmap

### Description

# Feature Description

llama.h should prefer to use `sized` (always) + `signed` (mostly) integers.

# Motivation

The integer types in `llama.h` right now are.

| Count | Type            |
|---------|------------------|
| 33      | `int`              |
| 10      | `int32_t`       |
| 24      | `uint32_t`     |
| 2        | `int64_t`       |
| 2        | `uint64_t`    | 

In #4540 there was a discussion around preferences for integer types on new methods. 

Avoiding `int` makes cross platform code simpler at essentially no cost.
Signed makes arithmetic simpler at the cost of some bits if you need something large.

# Possible Implementation

1. Change all `int`'s to `int32_t`
2. As code changes try to prefer signed integers.

We could also do some higher-impact things, but I'd take the lower-impact slower changes over a large find-and-replace.

## Issue #N/A: deprecate llama_batch_get_one and llama_get_logits

**Link**: https://github.com/ggml-org/llama.cpp/issues/4491

**Closed**: 2024-10-10T01:07:34+00:00
**Comments**: 5
**Labels**: refactoring, stale

### Description

We should deprecate these functions so people do not use them in new code. But we would first have to stop using them in our own code, which is easier said than done. For example, I tried to understand what beam search was using for a batch size, and gave up:

### Description

There have been a few reports where the grammar sampling can significantly degrade the performance.
It would be nice to profile and optimize the implementation - there should be room for improvements.

Already on-going efforts:

- #4210 
- #4213

Probably worth looking in multi-threading the implementation as well.

ref https://github.com/ggerganov/llama.cpp/discussions/499#discussioncomment-7478602

We should be able to run inference on multiple graphs, backends and devices in parallel.
Currently, there are CUDA singletons that break this requirement and possibly there could be other problems.

## Issue #N/A: ggml : deprecate ggml_alibi by replacing it with ggml_add

**Link**: https://github.com/ggml-org/llama.cpp/issues/3470
**State**: closed
**Created**: 2023-10-04T13:28:58+00:00

**Labels**: good first issue, refactoring

### Description

Since `ggml_alibi` is effectively a tensor addition, I think it would be better to replace it with `ggml_add`, similar to what we did with `ggml_diag_mask_inf()` in #3228 

This change would be useful since we won't need dedicated kernels for this operator and gives more flexibility to the user code

**Labels**: good first issue, high priority, refactoring

### Description

With the support of new model architectures, we start to observe a lot of repeating patterns in the code for building their compute graphs. We should find a way to refactor and reuse the repetitive code. We should also consider splitting the implementation in separate source files if necessary.

### Description

Create a struct `ggml_metal_locals` and populate using `GGML_TENSOR_LOCALS` similar to what we do in `ggml.c`:

https://github.com/ggerganov/llama.cpp/blob/3b4bab6a38502d9e68587c2c19f26472480ec4dd/ggml.c#L244-L256

Refactor all kernels to accept a single struct of `ggml_metal_locals` in order to avoid long lists of arguments such as:

### Description

The `llama_context_params` size should be a constant - should not depend on compile-time constants:

https://github.com/ggerganov/llama.cpp/blob/d01bccde9f759b24449fdaa16306b406a50eb367/llama.h#L91

Easiest change is to make this a pointer

## Issue #N/A: llama : refactor model loading code

### Description

In `llama.cpp` we have logic for supporting some very old model formats and features such as sharded models which is making the code unnecessary complicated and difficult to maintain. We should simplify it and remove support for old stuff that is no longer used.

Additionally, with the upcoming unified file format (https://github.com/ggerganov/ggml/issues/220) we will have to look into reimplementing the code to use it and add support for loading non-LLaMA models as well. This will be an important step towards adding inference of new models such as MPT and Falcon. Therefore, simplifying the logic as much as possible will help to easily adopt the new unified file format when it is ready
