## Issue #N/A: Running a Vicuna-13B 4it model ?

**Link**: https://github.com/ggml-org/llama.cpp/issues/771
**State**: closed
**Created**: 2023-04-05T07:33:04+00:00
**Closed**: 2023-07-28T19:47:57+00:00
**Comments**: 25
**Labels**: model, generation quality

### Description

I found this model : 
[[ggml-vicuna-13b-4bit](https://huggingface.co/eachadea/ggml-vicuna-13b-4bit)](https://huggingface.co/eachadea/ggml-vicuna-13b-4bit/tree/main) and judging by their online demo it's very impressive.
I tried to run it with llama.cpp latest version - the model loads fine, but as soon as it loads it starts hallucinating and quits by itself. 
Do I need to have it converted or something like that ?

I am attempting to run BFCL on llama-server, and so far I have triggered a crash twice.  It does not appear to be deterministic, unfortunately.  In one instance, I was able to catch the crash with gdb.  Here is the end of the backtrace:

## Issue #N/A: examples for iOS (objc / swift ui)

**Link**: https://github.com/ggml-org/llama.cpp/issues/3284
**State**: closed

### Description

I really enjoyed the examples for running whisper.cpp on iOS using both objective-c and swift-ui (found at https://github.com/ggerganov/whisper.cpp/tree/master/examples/whisper.objc and https://github.com/ggerganov/whisper.cpp/tree/master/examples/whisper.swiftui respectively) and was wondering if the process can be recreated for this repository. I believe that having a minimal example repository would be useful. 

I'd be willing to make an attempt, but I need to familiarize myself with the process that was performed in the whisper.cpp repository.

## Issue #N/A: Is it normal that ROCm+HIPBLAS produces different results than on CPU or breaks completely?

### Description

Hello. I did some perplexity tests while investigating issue with Llama-3. Initially the issue was that Llama-3 base 70b model outputs garbage with small quants with iMatrix. Can't find any information regarding that ROCm possibly causes corruption.

### GPU test (RX 7600 + RX 7600 XT)
https://huggingface.co/mradermacher/Meta-Llama-3-70B-i1-GGUF/tree/main
Meta-Llama-3-70B.i1-Q2_K.gguf prints [1]-nan,[2]-nan,[3]-nan,[4]-nan with -ngl 30 or 0 (prints garbage unless -ngl 0)
https://huggingface.co/mradermacher/Meta-Llama-3-70B-GGUF/tree/main
Meta-Llama-3-70B.Q2_K.gguf - seems OK, [1]4.1839,[2]4.7300,[3]4.2751,[4]4.6444,[5]4.6942,[6]5.0426,[7]5.1405,[8]5.4747
Final estimate: PPL = 5.9315 +/- 0.03553

### Pure CPU test
Meta-Llama-3-70B.i1-Q2_K.gguf with pure CPU 'perplexity' build (146 seconds per 512 tokens - ETA 26 hours 55.67 minutes)
[1]6.3962,[2]7.1886,[3]6.9886,[4]7.3853,[5]7.8924,[6]8.2982,[7]8.8956,[8]9.3799, (can't wait for many hours, stopped)

## Issue #N/A: Misc. bug: vulkan on 6900xt

**Comments**: 24
**Labels**: bug-unconfirmed

### Description

### Name and Version

Latest vulkan patches cause problems in koboldCPP for radeon 6900xt.

### Operating systems

Windows

### Which llama.cpp modules do you know to be affected?

llama-quantize

### Command line

```shell

```

### Problem description & steps to reproduce

I reported a problem with vulkan on the KoboldCPP project page, and was asked to report the problem here (newly released koboldcpp version with latest fixes for vulkan).

https://github.com/LostRuins/koboldcpp/issues/1398

As I wrote in the bug report on KoboldCPP, I have two cards GTX 1080ti and Radeon 6900xt. When the creator of Koboldcpp included the latest patches for vulkan, my radeon stopped working properly with vulkan.

I have tested various models (llama 3.1, nemo, mistral small 22/24b) and in none of them vulkan on radeon 6900xt works correctly anymore, either some random characters are generated from the very beginning, or the response loops very quickly and repeats some word.

## Issue #N/A: Bug: llama.cpp with Vulkan not running on Snapdragon X + Windows (Copilot+PCs)

**Link**: https://github.com/ggml-org/llama.cpp/issues/8455
**State**: closed
**Created**: 2024-07-12T10:25:53+00:00
**Closed**: 2025-01-31T01:07:14+00:00
**Comments**: 25
**Labels**: bug-unconfirmed, stale, low severity

### Description

### What happened?

The new Copilot+PCs with Qualcomm Snapdragon X processors (in my case a Surface 11 Pro with Snapdragon X Plus and 16GB RAM) are fast, and run llama.cpp on the CPU w/o issues. They also include a Vulkan driver and run the Vulkan samples w/o problems. But llama.cpp built with Vulkan does (now finally build,) but not run.

_llama-cli is terminating on model-load with:_
llama_model_load: error loading model: vk::Device::createComputePipeline: ErrorUnknown
llama_load_model_from_file: failed to load model
main: error: unable to load model

### Name and Version

llama-cli version: 3378 (71c1121d) with a quick-fix to compile (see #8446), built with MSVC 19.40.33812.0 for ARM64

_built with:_
Installed VulkanSDK for Windows x64, then built a Windows arm64 version of KhronosGroup/Vulkan-Loader vulkan-1.lib (+tested its functionality with tests+samples) and copied it to VulkanSDK lib-directory for llama.cpp building.

## Issue #N/A: Bug: Qwen2-72B-Instruct (and finetunes) Q4_K_M, Q5_K_M generates random output with CuBLAS prompt processing

**Labels**: bug-unconfirmed, stale, high severity

### Description

### What happened?

Qwen2-72B-Instruct Q4_K_M generates output with random tokens (numbers, special symbols, random chunks of words from different languages, etc).

Has been tested on:
1) Tesla P40 24gb + CPU partitioning with offloating half of the layers
2) Inference fully on RAM (on another pc from 1)

Other people say it works with Q6, maybe the problem is with Q4_K_M (i can't test q6).

I've tried with both FlashAttention on and off and MMQ on and off, doesn't work.

I tested with llama.cpp binaries, koboldcpp, text-generation-webui - doesn't work everywhere.

# Expected Behavior

My GGML converted models should be easy to convert to GGUF.
I know the conversion tools aren't guaranteed but I'd like to file this one in case anybody else has a workaround or more version flexible option. I would love to see any version of GGML/GGJT supported i

## Issue #N/A: Eval bug: Qwen2-VL Hallucinates image content on Vulkan backend

### Description

### Name and Version

ggml_vulkan: Found 1 Vulkan devices:
ggml_vulkan: 0 = AMD Radeon RX 5700 XT (AMD proprietary driver) | uma: 0 | fp16: 1 | warp size: 64 | matrix cores: none
version: 4329 (89d604f2)
built with MSVC 19.41.34120.0 for x64

### Operating systems

Windows

### GGML backends

### Hardware

### Models

Qwen2-VL-7B-Instruct-IQ4_NL + mmproj-Qwen2-VL-7B-Instruct-f32

### Problem description & steps to reproduce

When I run it on Vulkan build, the description given by the model has nothing to do with the image given as argument (no matter the `-ngl` value, even `-ngl 0` is broken). The exact same setup works perfectly fine on CPU backend.

I know the Vulkan backend doesn't support Qwen2-VL yet, but according to https://github.com/ggerganov/llama.cpp/pull/10361#issuecomment-2543938139, this should only cause slowdowns, not invalid outputs.

Flan T5 Large

### Problem description & steps to reproduce

I have a finetuned Flan T5 Model in my local which I have quantized and converted to gguf format using llama.cpp using the below line of command:

!python {path to convert_hf_to_gguf.py} {path to hf_model} --outfile {name_of_outputfile.gguf} --outtype {quantization type}

and loaded the gguf file using llama.cpp Llama

from llama_cpp import Llama 
gguf_model_path = "t5_8bit.gguf"
model = Llama(model_path=gguf_model_path)

and when trying to use the model at inference in Jupyter Notebook, the kernel is Dying. When tried the same in Command Prompt, getting the aasertion issue "GGML_ASSERT(n_outputs_enc > 0 && "call llama_encode() first") failed"

used the below code for inference in CPU and the issue is detected at model.eval()

Code:

### Description

Hello, 
to reduce my brain usage even more I thought i'd be nice to run AI which is specifically trained to code and thus hopefully make better code than other language models which are trained for e.g. natural language.

So I found this: https://huggingface.co/jordiclive/gpt4all-alpaca-oa-codealpaca-lora-13b

I of course wanted to try and run it but there's a problem, there aren't even any pytorch_model files or any 4bit variants listed here: https://github.com/underlines/awesome-marketing-datascience/blob/master/awesome-ai.md

Thank your for your support!
