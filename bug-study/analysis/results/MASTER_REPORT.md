# LLM Serving Framework Issue Analysis - Master Report
Generated: 2025-07-23 09:47:01

## Executive Summary

This comprehensive analysis examines issue management patterns across three major LLM serving frameworks:
- **vLLM**: High-performance LLM serving engine
- **SGLang**: Structured generation language framework  
- **llama.cpp**: CPU/GPU inference for LLaMA models

The analysis covers temporal patterns, user behavior, label usage, state transitions, and cross-framework comparisons
using statistical and data mining techniques without NLP/LLM assistance.

## Methodology

This analysis employed statistical and data mining techniques including:

1. **Temporal Analysis**: Time series analysis, seasonal decomposition, anomaly detection
2. **User Behavior**: Social network analysis, Gini coefficient, retention metrics
3. **Label Analysis**: Co-occurrence matrices, entropy calculation, evolution tracking
4. **State Transitions**: Markov-like state analysis, survival analysis concepts
5. **Cross-Framework**: Normalized comparisons, correlation analysis

All analyses were performed without NLP or LLM assistance, focusing on quantitative patterns
and structural relationships in the data.

## Data Sources

- **vLLM**: 9,631 issues (1,831 open + 7,800 closed)
- **SGLang**: 2,567 issues  
- **llama.cpp**: 5,470 issues

Data collected via GitHub API and analyzed using Python with pandas, numpy, matplotlib, and seaborn.

## Recommendations

Based on the analysis, we recommend:

1. **For vLLM**: Focus on reducing resolution time variance and improving label standardization
2. **For SGLang**: Enhance user retention strategies and community engagement
3. **For llama.cpp**: Implement more systematic labeling and improve response times
4. **Cross-Framework**: Share best practices, particularly in community management and issue triage

## Future Work

- Implement predictive models for issue resolution time
- Develop automated issue classification systems
- Create real-time monitoring dashboards
- Conduct deeper root cause analysis of long-standing issues
