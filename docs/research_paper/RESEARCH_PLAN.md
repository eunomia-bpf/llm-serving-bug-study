# Research Plan: Production Bugs and Performance Issues in LLM Serving Frameworks

## Executive Summary

This research investigates production bugs and performance issues across three major open-source LLM serving frameworks: vLLM, llama.cpp, and SGLang. Through analysis of 12,349 GitHub issues, we identify common failure patterns, root causes, and potential solutions for improving reliability in production LLM deployments.

## Research Questions

1. **What are the most common production failure modes in LLM serving systems?**
2. **How do different architectural approaches affect system reliability?**
3. **What are the key performance bottlenecks in production deployments?**
4. **How can we categorize and prioritize bugs for maximum impact?**
5. **What best practices emerge from analyzing production issues?**

## Methodology

### Data Collection
- **vLLM**: 4,078 issues (1,700 open, 2,378 closed)
  - 3,612 production-related issues
  - 2,225 bug/performance issues analyzed
- **llama.cpp**: 5,470 issues (281 open, 5,189 closed)
  - 4,740 production-related issues
  - 2,601 bug/performance issues analyzed
- **SGLang**: 2,567 issues (536 open, 2,031 closed)
  - 2,201 production-related issues
  - 106 bug/performance issues analyzed

### Analysis Framework
1. **Automated categorization** using keyword matching and NLP
2. **Manual sampling** of representative issues per category
3. **Root cause analysis** of critical failures
4. **Performance profiling** of reported bottlenecks

## Key Findings (Preliminary)

### 1. Issue Category Distribution

| Category | Total Issues | Distribution |
|----------|-------------|--------------|
| API/Endpoint | 1,070 | vLLM: 497, llama.cpp: 470, SGLang: 103 |
| Model Loading | 944 | vLLM: 457, llama.cpp: 406, SGLang: 81 |
| GPU/CUDA | 887 | vLLM: 430, llama.cpp: 383, SGLang: 74 |
| Concurrency | 690 | vLLM: 396, llama.cpp: 233, SGLang: 61 |
| Scaling | 350 | vLLM: 184, llama.cpp: 153, SGLang: 13 |

### 2. Critical Production Issues

#### Memory Management
- **OOM errors** during batch processing
- **Memory leaks** in long-running deployments
- **VRAM fragmentation** with dynamic batching

#### Concurrency & Race Conditions
- **KV cache corruption** in multi-threaded scenarios
- **Request timeouts** under high load
- **Deadlocks** in distributed settings

#### GPU Utilization
- **CUDA errors** with specific model architectures
- **Performance degradation** with mixed precision
- **Multi-GPU synchronization** issues

### 3. Framework-Specific Patterns

#### vLLM
- High issue volume but active resolution (41.7% open)
- Complex concurrency bugs due to advanced features
- Performance issues with prefix caching

#### llama.cpp
- Aggressive issue closure (5.1% open)
- Many unconfirmed bugs (45% marked stale)
- C++ memory management challenges

#### SGLang
- Best issue management practices
- Fewer production deployments (newer framework)
- Focus on high-priority bugs
